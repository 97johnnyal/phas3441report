\section{Group Organisation (MM)}
\subsection{Assigned Roles}
Central to any successful project is effective, efficient division of labour, in order to ensure that all necessary tasks are accomplished on time, and to a high standard. In order to accomplish this, it was decided that the project, having two clear avenues to follow, required the creation of two subgroups: An experimental group and a simulation group. The former were to handle the creation of the apparatus, experimentation and preliminary outreach efforts, whilst the latter were to handle the creation of a simulation that could effectively display these physical phenomenon. Of course, due to the varied nature of the project and constantly fluctuating workloads, several changes were made to personnel roles over the course of the project. Therefore, a brief outline of each group member's responsibilities is given below:

\subsection{Budget}
To carry out this project, we received an initial sum of \pounds200. This was to include all manufacturing costs, alongside the cost of poster printing. It was an ambitious limit, considering previous investigations of a similar similar were carried out in full-fledged research laboratories, with the corresponding resources. Nevertheless, some of the initial objectives were accomplished, with a substantial sum being left over at the summation of \todo{insert final sum left here before final print} of the project. The full expenditure details are given in Table \ref{table:budget}.
