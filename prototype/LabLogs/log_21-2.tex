\textbf{Participants:} SV, KF

\textbf{Location:} Year 1 Teaching Lab, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London

\textbf{Start time:} 0930

\textbf{End time:} \ 1300

\textbf{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
\item To achieve high speed recording of bouncing droplets, standing waves, `walking', `orbiting' and possibly double slit
\item Setting up the high speed camera and calibrating
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\textbf{Equipment added/modified; safety precautions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Ultra high speed camera
\item Photron Lighting
\item High speed camera software on laptop
\item Regular Camera for recording
\item Diffuser
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\textbf{What processes were carried out?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Usual set up for the experiment, used soap water as liquid - although superglued slits down before adding liquid in a region of the petri dish - not sure how glue will mix with soap
\item Tried to find a best angle and distance such that the camera is focused; positioned spotlight; adjusted the amount of light captured by shutter to enhance visualization on computer
\item Set frame rate at 1000 fps for slow-mo recording, this gives a total video time of around 8 s
\item Captured at Faraday instability as well
\item Continuously produced water waves to detect interference with slit
\item Recorded with diffuser to remove polarised light
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\textbf{Key findings/observations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Temperature: 18.8 degrees C
\item Interference patterns, not sure if from droplet
\item Video size at 1000 fps is around 2 GB per second
\item Irregular bouncing amplitudes, verified previous graphs
\item Risk of disconnection during file saving
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\textbf{What could be improved?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Toothpick rotating mechanism to push droplets to slits
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\textbf{Action plan for next session}

\begin{itemize}
\item Testing with LED strip under ambient light
\item Other frequencies (since soap water's viscosity is not the same)
\end{itemize}
