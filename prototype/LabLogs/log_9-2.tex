\textbf{Participants:} Steven, Mohit, Kelvin

\textbf{Location:} Engineering UB54

\textbf{Start time:} 1200

\textbf{End time:} 1500

\textbf{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
\item Record bouncing oil droplets
\item Stable oil droplets
\item Walking droplets
\item Orbiting droplets
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\textbf{Equipment added/modified; safety precautions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Sony camera (1000 fps) ZEISS 
\item Computer monitor
\item 2x lighting
\item 1 mm square graph paper
\item Clips
\item Trigger
\item Audio spectrum app / Frequency setting app
\item Fat syringe
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\textbf{What processes were carried out?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Put graph paper underneath the petri dish and over the speaker board, clamped on with office clips
\item Worked in dark room
\item Attempted to use the Griffin function generator, but no detectable signal on the amplifer.

\begin{itemize}
\item Device is not grounded, so it doesn't read correctly from the function generator
\item Resolved it through using a smartphone function generator app.
\end{itemize}
\item Used high speed camera, focus was fiddly
\item Started with 80 Hz and attempted to find the droplet diameter
\item Dropped to 50 Hz and the droplets appeared more stable
\item Polaroid attempted
\item Record as frequency changes
\item Coalesce at 77 Hz
\item {}``Walking droplet'' at regular speed recording (25 fps)
\item Side on recordings by forcing droplets toward near edge of dish
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\textbf{Key findings/observations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Stroboscopic effect
\item Intermittent frequencies
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\textbf{What could be improved?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Common ground required, there was only a floating ground. In the future only smartphone will be used
\item Filtering light with a polaroid
\item Smooth the light with a diffuser
\item Non level table/box
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\textbf{Action plan for next session}

\begin{itemize}
\item Look at video footage and decide on next actions

\begin{itemize}
\item Learning to use Adobe After Effects
\end{itemize}
\item Laptop signal generator
\item High speed camera - how to operate? - Email photography people
\item Submerge fringe into oil to act as double slit for droplets

\begin{itemize}
\item Create fringe at IoM
\item Seeking for square dish
\end{itemize}
\item More consistent droplet size

\begin{itemize}
\item Pipette from Chemistry
\item Syringe with needle
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
