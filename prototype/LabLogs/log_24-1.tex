\textbf{Participants:} Steven, Mohit, Benji, Kelvin

\textbf{Location:} Year 1 Teaching Lab, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London

\textbf{Start time:} 1400

\textbf{End time:} 1600

\textbf{Objectives}

To assemble the basic system in order to test vibration and attempt to create an oil droplet with a needle.
\bigskip

\textbf{Equipment added/modified; safety precautions}

Double-sided tape, cardboard piece, Silicone oil (1000 cSt), Griffin signal generator
\bigskip

\textbf{What processes were carried out?}

\begin{itemize}
\item The cardboard piece was secured using double-sided tape onto the edge of the loudspeaker, away from the diaphragm. An initial amount of about 4 mm of oil was poured into the 4'' petri dish
\item Used a needle to stimulate droplets

\begin{itemize}
\item A glass syringe was also tried
\item Attempted to use a clamp to avoid unnecessary shaking
\item Obtained a very thin wire to produce smaller droplets
\end{itemize}
\item Used ISO-TECH Synthesised Function Generator GFG2004 to drive 

\begin{itemize}
\item Switched to a different function generator (Griffin)
\item Played around with the different settings: attenuation, output impedance
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\textbf{Key findings/observations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Smaller droplets bounce better
\item It was also better to drop from a lower height
\item This allowed us to sustain a droplet for around 10 s before coalesce 
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\textbf{What could be improved?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Amplitude - almost non-visible
\item Droplets - not small enough
\item Oil viscosity - could be too viscous
\item Cardboard layer - not rigid enough, possible damping
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\textbf{Action plan for next session}

\begin{itemize}
\item Find an amplifier to increase output
\item Find a finer needle (Benji)
\item Seek for a rigid base replacement of around 165 mm (Steven, Kelvin)

\begin{itemize}
\item Try wood (easy to obtain from IoM)
\item Try hard plastic (consider printing with 3D Printer)
\item Aluminium
\end{itemize}
\item Try oils of different viscosity (Mohit)

\begin{itemize}
\item Or try to drive at a higher frequency
\end{itemize}
\item Testing with negative attenuation
\item Perhaps stick the petri dish directly onto the loudspeaker
\end{itemize}
