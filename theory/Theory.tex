\subsection{Droplet motion}
The basis of this investigation lies on the motion of moving droplets on a liquid surface. In 1978 it was reported by J. Walker \cite{Walker} that droplets vibrating at a certain frequency upon a soap-solution surface would not immediately coalesce, but could maintain motion for up to 18 minutes. Couder \textit{et al.} further researched this phenomenon in 2005. Using a silicon oil surface(with no soap-substrate) they discovered that it was possible to create a   an oscillating droplet at certain frequencies, and even walking droplets that moved parallel to the surface. 
The walking droplets were created by simply vibrating the liquid surface vertically at a frequency determined by (\ref{eq:bouncing regime condition}):

\begin{equation} \label{eq:bouncing regime condition}
\frac{\gamma_{m}^{B}}{g}\approx 1
\end{equation}
Where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\gamma_{m}^{B}$ is the specific value of co-efficient $\gamma_{m}$ of (\ref{eq:vertical acceleration}):


\begin{equation} \label{eq:vertical acceleration}
\gamma=\gamma_{m}cos(2 \pi f_0t) 
\end{equation}

(\ref{eq:vertical acceleration}) determines $\gamma$, which is the vertical acceleration of the fluid, $f_0$ is the driving frequency of the liquid and $t$ is time. The droplets bounce due to a remarkably simple mechanism. Upon collision of a droplet with the liquid, there exists a thin layer of air trapped between the two surfaces. Normally, the droplet will coalesce with a surface in a matter of seconds, as this air is forced away. But above a threshold value of $\gamma_{m}$, the droplet will instead bounce, as the air film retains its integrity, forcing the droplet upwards. By specifying a threshold vertical acceleration, it is also ensured that the air film will have a chance to replenish after each subsequent bounce, allowing the motion to be periodic over a large period of time. The regimes in which different types of motion occur are described in Figure \ref{regimes}.

Furthermore, droplets can also exhibit motion parallel to the droplet surface. Such droplets are labelled walkers, and like bouncing droplets, they exist in a certain $\frac{\gamma_{m}}{g}$ regime, just below the onset of the Faraday instability. The Faraday instability can be defined as the point at which a surface becomes spontaneously wavy. Just before its onset, a bouncing droplet has a period of motion twice that of its driving oscillation. It thus generates a damped travelling Faraday wave at each bounce where Faraday waves are standing waves generated by a vibrating liquid. The subsequent landing then occurs on the reverse slope of this previously generated Faraday wave. This landing generates another travelling Faraday wave, and causes the droplet to perform a parabolic bounce, causing motion parallel to the surface. An intuitive way to understand this motion is to imagine jumping on a trampoline. Each time you land on the trampoline, a wave is generated. If you land again anywhere but at the centre of this wave, you spring off again, and your motion has a slight horizontal component, allowing you to travel around the trampoline. As the wave you generate when landing travels, you constantly land on its side, therefore there is a constant horizontal motion, allowing you to 'walk' around the trampoline. This motion is illustrated in Figure \ref{walker}.

\subsection{Section about discussion of Me parameter and it's influence on walking states}
The memory parameter,  $Me$ , is essentially a representation of the decay time of a wave produced from a given impact. It is defined by the ratio between the non-dimensional damping time $\tau$ and the faraday period of the system $T_f$.
A droplet entering a walking state is a direct result of the of this memory parameter and can seen by the comparison of the high and low memory regimes. {Information stored in Faraday waves: the origin of a path memory}
In the high memory regime, the waves decay slowly, and so waves created in the distant past can still strongly influence the particle trajectory. However, in the low memory regime, the waves decay rapidly, so only waves created in the recent past can significantly influence the particle's trajectory.

\subsection{Fluid Dynamics}
If the height of the oil is known for the entire surface, the trajectory after a bounce at any point can be calculated using basic equations of motion. On collision, the impulse received by the droplet is found to be proportional to the gradient of the surface. This can then be used to find the velocity until the next collision.
