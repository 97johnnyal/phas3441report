\section{Conclusion}



In conclusion, only some of the initially stated aims and oobjectives were accomplished. A basic, table-top version of the apparatus created by \cite{couder} was manufactured, capable of displaying bouncing, walking and orbiting motion. However, this apparatus proved incapable of demonstrating more complex behaviour such as double slit diffraction. A suitable programming language was identified, and initial forays into developing a computer simulation were made. However, numerous setbacks meant that the only qualitative observations were made, and these agreed well with the experimental apparatus. A pilot outreach lesson with year 12 students was conducted, with generally positive feedback obtained.
